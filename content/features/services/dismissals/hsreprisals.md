The core of our mandate is to represent workers who are disciplined or fired for raising health and safety concerns at work. Some common health and safety concerns are unsafe working conditions, workplace harassment, workplace violence, poor ventilation or exposure to chemical hazards. These are just a few of the health and safety concerns that can arise in any workplace.

WHSLC lawyers are experienced in advocacy before the Ontario Labour Relations Board and in seeking remedies such as lost wages, general damages, and reinstatement to work.
