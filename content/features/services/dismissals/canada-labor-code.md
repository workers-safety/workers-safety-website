### Unjust Dismissals

We represent workers who were employed in federally regulated workplaces (such as banks, telecommunications, inter-provincial transportation) and dismissed in a manner that does not comply with the _Canada Labour Code_ (CLC). The CLC contains unjust dismissal provisions that apply to non-managerial workers employed for 12 months (1 year) or more who are dismissed without just cause. We also represent workers in federally regulated workplaces that have been punished or fired for raising an occupational health and safety issue or concern.
