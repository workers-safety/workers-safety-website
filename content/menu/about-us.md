# **Who We Are**

The Workers’ Health and Safety Legal Clinic (WHSLC) is a community legal aid clinic that focuses on workers’ rights with an emphasis on workplace health and safety issues and employment law issues.

Our lawyers provide free information, legal advice, referrals and representation to low-income workers who face health and safety problems at work and/or other violations of their rights. We act for workers to promote health and safety in the workplace, and in particular, for those who are unlawfully punished or terminated for raising health and safety concerns and/or employment related concerns.

We are funded by Legal Aid Ontario (LAO) and are a specialty legal clinic within LAO's system of community legal clinics and specialty legal clinics.

# Staff

The WHSLC employs three lawyers and two community legal workers. We offer articling opportunities when funding is available, and law student volunteer positions are possible where oversight is available.

# Board of Directors

The WHSLC is governed by a volunteer Board of Directors elected by our membership. Our Board members come from a variety of backgrounds and share a common interest in employment-related and health and safety issues from the worker perspective. Currently, many of our Board members have had experience with health and safety issues at work or were injured in the workplace.

Being a volunteer Board member is an opportunity to network, to meet others who share your commitment, and to enrich your own skills, knowledge and experience. While no particular legal experience is required, our Board strives to have members with a variety of experience and knowledge. 
 
Board members must be WHSLC [members](/member/) and must sign our Confidentiality Statement. Board members are elected for two-year terms and also participate on Board Committees.
