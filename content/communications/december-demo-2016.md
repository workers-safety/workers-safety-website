## **Join us for the 25th Annual Injured Worker Demonstration on Monday, December 12th, 2016 at 11am!** 

We will speak out on workers’ compensation issues that affect injured workers, their families and friends. This year, we are taking our message to the **Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB)** in Toronto.

We are gathering at 11am in Simcoe Park, just next to the WSIB located at Simcoe Place, 200 Front Street West.
