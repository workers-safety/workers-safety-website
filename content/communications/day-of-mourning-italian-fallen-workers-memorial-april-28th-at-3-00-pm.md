+++
Last year, on April 28, the Committee for the Italian Fallen Workers Memorial Project was proud to formally unveil the Italian Fallen Workers Memorial Wall honouring almost one thousand workers of Italian origin who have been killed in workplace tragedies across Ontario.


This year, the Committee will be adding hundreds of names and broadening the project to include workers of Italian origin who were killed in these terrible workplace tragedies across Canada, from 1900 to today. The overwhelming number of fallen workers of Italian origin who were discovered after the Memorial Wall was unveiled last year, will be honoured as a new part of the Italian Fallen Workers Memorial Wall.


The memorial ceremony will be held on April 28, 2017, at 3:00 pm at the Villa Charities campus in the Memorial Gardens, located behind Columbus Centre (Lawrence and Dufferin, Toronto).


The ceremony is set to coincide with the International Day of Mourning for Fallen Workers – a day which formally recognizes all fallen workers killed, injured or made ill due to their work. This day is one, which as Canadians we can be proud of, because it was the idea of the Canadian Labour Congress in 1984, and is now honoured in countries all across the globe.
