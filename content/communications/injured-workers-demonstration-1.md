On Monday December 11th, join us in communities across the province, to celebrate the strength and resilience of injured workers who refuse to back down from the struggle for fair compensation.

The holiday season can be a difficult time for injured workers who have been forced into poverty because of the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board's focus on saving its own money by slashing compensation benefits. But injured workers are still here, and are only growing more determined to rebuild a workers’ compensation system that operates with integrity, and that treats them with dignity and respect.

As part of the holiday outreach blitz, we’ll be singing injured worker-themed carols, handing out leaflets, and collecting petition signatures for our **_Workers’ Comp is a Right_** campaign.

Have a look below at the communities that will be holding holiday actions, and see all the info on our [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/526224984404754/). Please click “going” and share widely!
