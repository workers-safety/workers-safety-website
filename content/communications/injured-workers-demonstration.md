The rally began at the WSIB’s Toronto office located at 200 Front Street West and then continued at the Ombudsman’s office located at 483 Bay Street. A letter voicing concerns with the WSIB was delivered to a representative of Ontario’s Ombudsman, Mr. J. Paul Dubé, to request that an investigation be made into the practices of the WSIB.
