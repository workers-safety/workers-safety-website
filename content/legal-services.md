# **What We Do**

The WHSLC provides legal services to low-income non-unionized workers who need assistance with legal matters that relate to their employment rights or their health and safety rights at work. Our legal services include summary legal advice, brief legal services, referrals, and legal representation. 

Scroll down for more information on our *areas of practice* which include **Unlawful Dismissals** and **Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB) matters**.

# Unlawful Dismissals

The WHSLC provides advice and representation on a number of unlawful dismissal matters including: 

* **Health and Safety Reprisals**
* **Employment Standards: Reprisals and Termination Pay/Severance Pay Claims**
* **Human Rights Applications: Employment and Disability**
* **Canada Labour Code: Unjust Dismissals and Reprisals**
* **Small Claims Court: Wrongful Dismissal and Constructive Dismissal Lawsuits**

### Health and Safety Reprisals

The core of our mandate is to represent workers who are disciplined or fired for raising health and safety concerns at work. Some common health and safety concerns are unsafe working conditions, workplace harassment, workplace violence, poor ventilation or exposure to chemical hazards. These are just a few of the health and safety concerns that can arise in any workplace. 

WHSLC lawyers are experienced in advocacy before the Ontario Labour Relations Board and in seeking remedies such as lost wages, general damages, and reinstatement to work.

-----
### Employment Standards: Reprisals

It is against the law for an employer or agency to punish or terminate workers for enforcing or trying to enforce the rights found under the *Employment Standards Act* (ESA). These rights include the right to receive minimum wage, overtime pay, pay stubs, sick leave, parental leave, termination pay, vacation pay, and much more.
 
WHSLC lawyers are available to appear at the Ontario Labour Relations Board to represent workers who have been disciplined/fired for exercising or trying to exercise their rights under the ESA. We also meet with Employment Standards Officers to help workers get their jobs back, lost wages and other remedies.

-----
### Employment Standards: Termination Pay and Severance Pay Claims 

The *Employment Standards Act* (ESA) requires that employers provide dismissed workers with proper notice of termination or termination pay *in lieu* (instead) of notice. We represent fired and laid off workers at the Ontario Labour Relations Board who have not been properly compensated by their employers.

-----
### Human Rights Applications: Employment and Disability

We represent workers who are dismissed from work because of a disability or because they asked for accommodation or a change in work duties due to a disability. We have acted for workers who lose their jobs simply for having an injury at work for which Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB) benefits were claimed.  

-----
### Canada Labour Code: Unjust Dismissals

We represent workers who were employed in federally regulated workplaces (such as banks, telecommunications, inter-provincial transportation) and dismissed in a manner that does not comply with the *Canada Labour Code* (CLC). The CLC contains unjust dismissal provisions that apply to non-managerial workers employed for 12 months (1 year) or more who are dismissed without just cause. We also represent workers in federally regulated workplaces that have been punished or fired for raising an occupational health and safety issue or concern.

-----
### Small Claims Court: Wrongful Dismissal and Constructive Dismissal Lawsuits

We file lawsuits against employers and represent workers who are wrongfully dismissed or laid off without proper notice or pay *in lieu* (instead) of notice. Additionally, if there is a fundamental change to working conditions that leave a worker with no option but to quit, we can represent workers in a lawsuit against the employer based on constructive dismissal.

-----
# Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB)

Workers covered by *Workplace Safety and Insurance Act* have the right to claim benefits from the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB). Benefits can include loss of earnings benefits (also known as workers’ compensation) or healthcare coverage. The WSIB also assists with return to work and retraining. We provide advice for all WSIB issues but representation only in specific types of claim issues like Return to Work and Suitable Employment Appeals as well as Occupational Disease Appeals.

-----
### Return to Work and Suitable Employment Appeals

The WSIB expects that workers will return to work with their employers. Often, workers are expected to return too soon or are expected to perform work they are physically unable to do. We provide representation and will attend return to work meetings with the worker. In cases where the worker cannot return to work with the employer, we will assist with appeals involving retraining or if there is an argument to be made against any return to work.

-----
### Occupational Disease Appeals

Long term exposures at the workplace can result in occupational diseases. Sometimes, doing the same tasks over and over can lead to repetitive strain injuries. We represent workers with these claims.
