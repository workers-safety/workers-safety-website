# **Financial Eligibility**

Our services are available, free of charge, to low-income non-unionized workers who need assistance with legal matters that fall within the Clinic’s area of practice. For more information on our areas of practice, visit the **Legal Services** section on our website. We use Legal Aid Ontario’s financial eligibility criteria to determine if you are eligible for services from our Clinic. This eligibility is based on household size and income.

-----
### Province of Ontario

Our Clinic’s service area extends across the province of Ontario. This means that in order to receive our legal services, you must have been working in Ontario at the time the health and safety or employment-related legal issue began. 

-----
### Non-Unionized Workers

Our services are intended for low-income workers who do not have union membership for protection. That being said, we also try to provide informational assistance to unionized workers and their unions and organizations.

**IMPORTANT - Please note:** If you are unsure whether we can help you, please contact us for more information. You may be asked some questions to assess if you are eligible for assistance. If we are unable to help you, we will provide you with information for other organizations, legal aid clinics or services that may be able to assist you.
